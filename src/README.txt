A3 / To The Arena
The player controls the giant Xilian mothership which carries the monster Gigan inside. An
arcball camera can be used to view the ship from all angles and zoom in and out. The ship can 
turn from side to side and move forward or backwards. The ship is unable to leave the city. The 
ship bobs up and down autonomously. Diffusion lighting casts a shadow on all objects in the world.
CONTROLS:
W - move the ship forward
S - move the ship backward
A - turn the ship to the left
D - turn the ship to the right
LMB + DRAG - rotate the camera in all directions around the ship
SHIFT + LMB + DRAG - zoom in and out (can only drag up and down)
Since I was in a hurry, some leftover code from lab05 still exists or is commented out.
This assignment took me 5 hours.
